# Celestial forge

Celestial forge is a complete 2D Game Engine, until in development.
It's completelly made in C# and with the minimum external resources possible.


## The past
The Engine was created just for fun, not money or fame involved.
The main objective of the Engine is be Open Souce and allow any contribuition and user costomization (as long as it doesn't deviate from the engine's main proposals).

## The present
For now i'm working on UIs, game process and the engine first custom language, DRASM.
The Engine is under development for now. Feel free to explore the repositories and branches of the project, as well contribute with pull requests, issue requests or comments.

## The future
After the first version release, i'm plainning to try to make a little dev group, implement 3D and a Image Editor.
